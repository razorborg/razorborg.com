This powers this blog now, along with a couple of others.</p><h2 id="intro">Intro</h2><p>I've spent time recently playing with blogging software <em>again... </em>It seems like every few years I go through this. I've run Drupal, I've run Wordpress, I had a server hacked in the days long before Cloud that scared me over to PAAS solutions like Blogger and Tumblr for awhile. Then I just used Facebook, then I got quiet on Facebook, then I got sick and we had to use Facebook to tell folks how I was, then I got better and had a lot more friends on Facebook, then I posted something "techy" that got like zero likes and I realized my Facebook friends <em>don't care</em> when I talk about software engineering, then I remembered I had a blog over here at razorborg.com, and I saw that I actually wrote a couple of interesting posts over the years, but then I realized it was still on Tumblr, which didn't make a whole lot of sense and I don't remember how it got there. But I've been learning some AWS for work and I've been playing with Google Cloud for some time after scoring some credits from attending an I/O a few years back, and I figured, why not, lets see what it takes to move this beast to something a lot more <em>modern</em>, right? So here we are.</p><p>I read a bunch of articles. I fired up some VM's. I tried some Bitnami one-click solutions. I remembered why I hate Wordpress, but why I might end up using it in the next version of my Cub Scout Pack's website.</p><p>Then I found this, which turned out to be the best tutorial I have found for running Ghost (which is <em>gorgeous</em>, and <em>clean</em>, and <em>responsive</em>, and <em>beautiful on a phone</em>, and <em>simple</em>, and just a joy out of the box) on a cloud VM:</p><blockquote><a href="https://blog.checkyo.tech/2018/06/28/ghost-docker-tutorial/">https://blog.checkyo.tech/2018/06/28/ghost-docker-tutorial/</a></blockquote><p>Aman, the author, is running on Digital Ocean, a cloud platform that I keep hearing great things about but I haven't had any professional reason (or free credits) to learn about. I have been playing with Google Cloud, however, and I know it enough to break stuff since I got my kids a cloud Minecraft server running up there last year. So why not try to get it running on Google?</p><p>Aman's tutorial rocked. And if I didn't find a few minor discrepancies on GCE, I wouldn't even be writing this post. Let's see what I did and where we diverged ...</p><h2 id="1-create-a-vm-instance-and-disks">1. Create a VM instance and disks</h2><p>I got this working just fine on a <code>f1-micro</code> instance. If you're running a single blog and you don't get much traffic, I'd say go with that. I eventually resized to "small" after I launched my third Ghost instance on this VM and got the "increase perf" warning from Google. My current setup looks like:</p><ul><li><code>ghost-1</code>: Machine Type: g1-small, running <code>Ubuntu 18.04</code></li><li><code>ghost-1</code>:Boot Disk: 10GB Standard Persistent Disk</li><li><code>ghost-content-1</code>: Data/Content Disk: 20GB Standard Persistent Disk (resizable later if necessary)</li></ul><p>Note that I created a second persistent disk, with a rule to keep the disk if the VM instance is deleted. This cleanly separates my blog content from the VM startup disk.</p><h2 id="2-install-docker">2. Install Docker</h2><p>This tutorial works just fine with Google's Cloud:</p><blockquote><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04">Digital Ocean's Guide to Installing Docker on Ubuntu 18.04</a></blockquote><h2 id="3-install-nginx">3. Install Nginx</h2><p>This is where things start to diverge. Do Step 1 here. <em>Do <strong>NOT</strong> do Step 2</em>...</p><blockquote><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-18-04">Digital Ocean's Guide to Installing Nginx on Ubuntu 18.04</a></blockquote><p>Google Compute Engine already has a firewall running outside the VM instance, so there is no need to run <code>ufw</code>. Moreover, if you do enable <code>ufw</code> and you only add the Nginx rules, <em>you will accidentally turn off SSH access to your host</em>.</p><p>Yes, I learned this the hard way.</p><h3 id="if-you-get-locked-out-">If you get locked out...</h3><p>In the unfortunate event that you lock yourself out of your VM because you firewalled the SSH port, there is a way back in. </p><ol><li>Create this bash shell script and put it somewhere on the web (like a storage bucket):</li></ol><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class="language-bash">#!/bin/bash

Under "Custom metadata", add the key <code>startup-script-url</code> with the URL to your script as the value.</p><p>4. Restart your VM</p><h2 id="4-install-docker-compose">4. Install docker-compose</h2><p>We are now at "Part 1" of Aman's tutorial. My VM didn't have <code>pip</code> installed, so I went the brute-force way to get <code>docker-compose</code>, a la <a href="https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-and-use-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-18-04/">this article</a>:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class="language-bash">$ sudo curl -L &quot;https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.23.1/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)&quot; -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="5-mount-your-content-drive">5. Mount your content drive</h2><p>If you created your content drive brand new when you set up your VM, you will have to format the drive and mount it. Here are Google's docs:</p><blockquote><a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/add-persistent-disk">Adding or Resizing Zonal Persistent Disks</a></blockquote><p>Skip down to <em>Formatting and mounting a zonal persistent disk</em>. </p><p>I mounted my disk at <code>/mnt/disks/ghost-content</code>.</p><h2 id="6-keep-following-aman-s-tutorial">6. Keep following Aman's tutorial</h2><p>From here on out, you can follow Aman's tutorial to get up and running. The steps are basically:</p><ol><li>Create a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file for the site you want to host<br>Note that I am creating these files at <code>/mnt/disks/ghost-content/site-name</code></li><li>Run the <code>ghost</code> container</li><li>Configure Nginx</li><li>Add SSL by using <code>certbot</code></li></ol><p>There's a lot of chatter in blogs about setting up cron jobs to run <code>certbot</code> periodically to renew SSL certs from LetsEncrypt. By following the steps in Aman's tutorial, I was left with a <code>systemd</code> script that does this automatically.</p><h2 id="7-startup-and-auto-updating-the-ghost-image">7. Startup and auto updating the ghost image</h2><p>Aman's tutorial ends with a script that updates the <code>ghost</code> Docker image and restarts it periodically. This is brilliant because that script will run at startup as well, so if you ever need to restart your VM, your site(s) will come right back up.</p><p>I extended the <code>update.sh</code> script a bit more to do this for multiple sites, and it works just fine.</p><h2 id="8-profit">8. Profit</h2><p>The rest is up to you! </p><h2 id="ps-migrating-from-tumblr-to-ghost">PS. Migrating from Tumblr to Ghost</h2><p>If you're most folks, you're probably migrating from Wordpress. Maybe Blogger. Go you. Somehow I ended up on Tumblr years ago. Tumblr is fine, but it's use case is really not what this blog is all about.</p><p>I found this...</p><blockquote><a href="https://www.ghostforbeginners.com/how-to-import-blog-posts-from-tumblr-to-ghost/">Migrating from Tumblr to Ghost</a></blockquote><p>...and thought, cool, now I have my Tumblr posts in a JSON file! But when I went in import, I discovered my JSON file could only be read by Ghost 1.x, and I was running a 2.x build. </p><p><em>Docker to the rescue...</em></p><ol><li>I deleted all content on my content disk for this blog</li><li>I updated <code>docker-compose.yml</code> to use the <code>ghost:1-alpine</code> image</li><li><code>sudo docker-compose up</code></li><li>Once the Ghost 1.x site was up, the content imported fine</li><li>Shut down the image with <code>Ctl-C</code> and revert <code>docker-compose.yml</code> to use <code>ghost:2-alpine</code></li><li><code>sudo docker-compose up</code> again, and the 2.0 image found my content and migrated it to the 2.0 formats. This took a little while. Be patient, it'll eventually come back up.</li></ol><h2 id="pps-301-redirect-links-from-tumblr-urls">PPS: 301 Redirect links from Tumblr URLs</h2><p>I spent awhile combing through my blog posts and weeding out the bitrot by deleting posts that linked to nowhere. Ah, life on the web. Leave anything alone for awhile, and things start breaking. </p><p>Changing platforms often means a change in the default URL structures, and Ghost isn't very flexible with its URLs. If you have any posts that others may have linked to in the past, <em>please</em> do some due diligence and keep their links alive. If you don't, they will be annoyed at you one day like I just was annoyed at others. </p><p>I found this, which I suspect works great for old Wordpress links with the date in the URLs:</p><blockquote><a href="https://davidzych.com/migrating-from-wordpress-to-ghost-301-urls/">Migrating from Wordpress to Ghost: 301'ing some urls</a></blockquote><p>And hey, I'm running Nginx too! Tumblr URLs take the form <code>post/{post-id}/{post-title}</code>, so it's pretty easy to update the redirect regex to handle them. Here's the line I added to my <code>server &gt; location</code> section:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class="language-bash">rewrite &quot;post/\d*/(.*)$&quot; /$1 permanent;
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>That regex says: 1) Look for urls that have <code>post/</code> followed by some amount of numbers follwed by <code>/</code> and "take" everything after that slash. Post titles should appear the same in Tumbler and Ghost URLs as long as the title doesn't change, so we're good to go!</p><h2 id="afterthoughts-and-next-steps-">Afterthoughts and next steps...</h2><p>I like this setup. I'm planning to run at least 3 sites on this machine, all using Ghost, and I'm pretty happy with where things are. </p><p>Eventually I will want to publish out to static pages and front this with a CDN, but I'm not generating enough traffic to worry about that too much. </p><p>So now, to start blogging again!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[ReactJS+GraphQL+Relay Performance on Facebook.com]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Excellent talk about performance in a ReactJS+GraphQL environment from the Facebook team. </p><!--kg-card-begin: embed--><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><div id="fb-root"></div>

<p><em>The challenge:</em> In Javascript, read 8 bytes out of an array (for instance, a file or a network packet) and turn it into a number. 53-bit precision is okay (Javascript stores numbers as 64-bit floats with a 53-bit mantissa). Use Uint8Array as our view into the byte array.</p>
<p>Other languages have 64-bit long ints, and this is straightforward. Other languages also have uints, which simplify dealing with 1&rsquo;s in the most significant bit. However, Javascript treats all numbers as floats with 53-bit precision (the remaining 11 bits are exponent). To get around this, there are a variety of Big Integer libraries that have popped up to enable 64-bit or string-backed arbitrary length large numbers. However, I&rsquo;m working with code that began its life in Java, and still has to work in Java, so I don&rsquo;t want to refactor much. Also, 53-bit precision is okay for this problem because these numbers are really only timestamps. I want to handle this math in an abstraction layer that gives me a regular Javascript number to use elsewhere.</p>
<h2>The classic approach: bit shifting</h2>
<p>The bit shifting approach works great in languages with 64-bit long ints and looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>for (var i = 0; i &lt; 8; i++) {
    if (i &gt; 0) num &lt;&lt;=8;
    num |= arr[i] &amp; 0xFF;
}
</code></pre>
<p>However, bit shifting in Javascript turns numbers into 32-bit integers (they fit nicely inside a 64 bit float). So this approach shifts your most significant four bytes out of the number entirely.</p>
<p>This won&rsquo;t work for us.</p>
<h2>The higher-level math approach: multiply and add</h2>
<p>Multiplying the number by 256 (0x100) and adding the next byte is the mathematical equivalent of left-shifting by 8, and we won&rsquo;t lose the upper 21 bits of precision. Moreover, since bit-shifting doesn&rsquo;t buy us any better performance in Javascript, using regular math is just fine. This approach looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>for (var i = 0; i &lt; 8; i++) {
    if (i &gt; 0) num *= 0x100;
    num += arr[i] &amp; 0xFF;
}
</code></pre>
<p>However, this produces some very wrong results when the number is negative and padded with 1&rsquo;s all the way to the left. After enough runs through the loop, <code>num</code> starts to look negative, and adding <code>arr[i]</code> to a negative number moves <code>num</code> in the wrong direction.</p>
<h2>The two 32-bit ints approach</h2>
<p>I eventually decided that it was a safer to read the 8 bytes into two 4 byte number words and calculate the correct 53-bit number. This way I wasn&rsquo;t going to lose any bits until I needed to throw away the upper 21 bits.</p>
<p>Much like the multiply-by-256-and-add approach, this works great (and easily) for positive numbers:</p>
<pre><code>for (var i = 0; i &lt; 8; i++) {
    if (i &lt; 4) {
        if (i &gt; 0) high = high * 0x100;
        high += arr[i] &amp; 0xFF;
    } else {
        if (i &gt; 4) low = low * 0x100;
        low += arr[i] &amp; 0xFF;
    }
}
num = high * 0x100000000 + low;
</code></pre>
<p>However, negatives are a problem now because we&rsquo;re only using the bottom 32 bits of a 53-bit float mantissa, so neither the high nor the low int word look like negative numbers until that multiplication step. (Remember this, it&rsquo;ll be important again later.) During the multiplication, if <code>high * 0x100000000</code> gives us a 1 in bit 53, it suddenly looks negative to Javascript, adding a positive <code>low</code> value to it, well, it&rsquo;s the wrong answer.</p>
<p>We have to be smarter.</p>
<h2>Two&rsquo;s Complement Math</h2>
<p>Negative numbers are represented in two&rsquo;s complement form, which, if you remember your CS101, gives us one extra number of representation than simply using a sign bit. It also makes for some elegant bit-level math. But we&rsquo;re in Javascript, so bit-level math isn&rsquo;t elegant anymore; in fact, it keeps getting us into trouble here.</p>
<p>Converting to a two&rsquo;s complement number is simple on paper: flip the bits and add one. Now you have the negative representation of your value. So this feels like it should work:</p>
<pre><code>if (high &gt;= 0x80000000) { // see if 64-bit number is negative
   high ^= 0xFFFFFFFF;
   low ^= 0xFFFFFFFF;
   num = -(high * 0x100000000 + low + 1);
}
</code></pre>
<p>But here&rsquo;s where Javascript gets weird again, and it&rsquo;s all about bit-level math suddenly turning numbers into 32-bit signed ints. Fire up a console or node and try this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; var num = 123;
&gt; num ^= 0xFFFFFFFF;
-124
</code></pre>
<p>See that negative number? If you flip the bits on the low word and there&rsquo;s a 1 at bit 32, the number goes negative. <code>high * 0x100000000 + low</code> is now a subtraction instead of an addition, and we get the wrong answer. We have the same problem we hit the last time we tried this line of code, except this time <code>low</code> is the negative value.</p>
<h2>Special case the low word</h2>
<p>So the way around this is to make sure, when we flip the bits of the low word, we never have a negative number. This seems to work:</p>
<pre><code>if (high &gt;= 0x80000000) {
    high ^= 0xFFFFFFFF;
    var lowIsPositive = false;
    if (low &lt; 0)
        low ^= 0xFFFFFFFF;
    else {
        lowIsPositive = true;
        low ^= 0x7FFFFFFF;
    }
    num = -(high * 0x100000000
        + low
        + 1
        + (lowIsPositive ? 0x80000000 : 0));
else
    num = high * 0x100000000 + low;
</code></pre>
<p><em>One curious note:</em> the last line of code still works without worrying about the sign of <code>low</code> because, when we read the bytes into the number, we used the multiply-and-add approach instead of the bit-shift approach. Even if the 32nd bit of <code>low</code> is a 1, it is still considered a positive number. Until, of course, we do some bitwise math and Javascript turns it into a 32 bit signed int.</p>
<h2>Morals</h2>
<p>My takeaways from this exercise are:</p>
<ul><li>Sometimes understanding number representation is even more important in high-level languages like Javascript than in low-level languages like C</li>
<li>Mixing bitwise and numeric math in Javascript is dangerous; be careful</li>

Lord knows we receive enough packages in the smiley boxes, and as they were the first to provide DRM-free MP3&rsquo;s, I long ago moved beyond iTunes as my personal <em>ownership</em> music library.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually long since moved beyond Amazon. It&rsquo;s been reported recently that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/access-over-ownership-future-consumption">the digital world is shifting us from ownership to access</a>, and Spotify has become my music library of choice over the last few years. It&rsquo;s library meets 95% of my musical taste, and anything remaining I deal with Amazon, iTunes, or both.</p>
<p>But October and November bring me to my annual ritual of selecting the cream of the past year&rsquo;s crop of music to be forever enshrined in a personal mix mp3. I buy the tracks I like the best from my Spotify playlists, and spend enough evenings geeking out in Audacity to be fully made fun of by my family. This is Fall, this is what I do.</p>
<p>This year Amazon is pushing their new Amazon Music app on PC/Mac, and since I generally like working with local tracks, I decided to give it a whirl.</p>
<p>What a f**king disaster.</p>
<p>I generally like CloudPlayer, and I generally like Amazon&rsquo;s mobile apps. But this year Amazon started pushing Prime Music, and it changed everything. And I hate it. I really. Really. Hate it. And it&rsquo;s starting to spill over into the mobile apps. Ugh.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really hard to be both subscription and point-of-sale, and Amazon has clearly not figured out which it would rather be upselling you on in its applications. The result is a bloated UI with too much up-sell space, and too many places to be&ndash;are we in my cloud library? My downloaded library? Browsing the store? Browsing Prime Music? IT&rsquo;S TOO MUCH. I have similar issues with Prime Movies, but I&rsquo;ll tackle movies some other day.</p>
<p>I could forgive Amazon all this mess if they would do one thing in the PC app. This is the real problem with Amazon Music:</p>
<p><b>DON&rsquo;T SEPARATE MY CLOUD PLAYLISTS FROM MY LOCAL ONES.</b></p>
<p>I want to edit a playlist, add tracks, maybe delete some, maybe change the order because sometimes I don&rsquo;t want to shuffle play them, and have this playlist available across all my devices. On some devices I want to download the files so that I can listen on a plane or in my car when I don&rsquo;t have a wifi signal, because I don&rsquo;t want to stream over mobile data.</p>
<p>One of those devices is my computer. I spend up to 16 hours of my day on my computer, far more than any of my mobile devices, and ooh: <i>I have like two hundred times more hard drive space than my phone has</i>, so OF COURSE I want to be able to sync local files but still be updating my cloud playlist.</p>
<p>As it stands today, Amazon Music on my Mac:</p>
<ul><li>Creates a new playlist when I download from my cloud library</li>
<li>Will create another new playlist when I download again from my cloud library (let&rsquo;s say I changed something on my phone or in CloudPlayer). Now I have two copies of almost the same playlist.</li>
<li>Won&rsquo;t let me drag tracks to rearrange.</li>
<li>Doesn&rsquo;t have an option to keep this in sync with my cloud playlist.</li>
<li>If I click &ldquo;Add Tracks&rdquo;, it bumps my playlist to the right-hand column (now I can drag to rearrange).</li>
<li>Has this annoying bug where if I click the &ldquo;back&rdquo; button to return to my playlist, it&rsquo;s now empty.</li>
</ul><p>If Amazon wants to create a media ecosystem that plays well across multiple devices, it needs to start thinking of the computer in the same way it thinks about it&rsquo;s mobile devices. I should be able to do more, and do it more easily, on my computer than on my phone, but the experience can&rsquo;t be broken.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&rsquo;m going back to Spotify.</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fun takeaways from the 2014 Internet Trends Report]]></title><description><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><b>&hellip;on user focus:</b></p>

<p>A year ago I was <a href="http://razorborg.com/post/47203216089/gmail-compose-apple-three-finger-swipe-and">complaining about Gmail&rsquo;s new compose feature</a>, and how it catered to the needs of chronic multi-taskers. I am still on my distraction-free rampage, and it seems the mobile world is &hellip; sort of &hellip; catching up with me.  At least, mobile users seem to be wanting to focus on one thing at a time on their phone screens (while they do six other things in real life).</p>
<p><b>&hellip;on video:</b></p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/gallery/mary-meeker-internet-trends/slide/35">http://techcrunch.com/gallery/mary-meeker-internet-trends/slide/35</a></p>
<p>First, video is everywhere, now that everyone has screens. This is great. This is one of the reasons I&rsquo;m working in video now.</p>
<p>Television channels are becoming their own interactive apps. This is also great. Video is being delivered with other types of content in coherent <i>multi-media</i> user experiences.  I&rsquo;ve been excited about this reality happening since I first starting writing BASIC programs in the late 80&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><b>&hellip;on the World Wide Web:</b></p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/gallery/mary-meeker-internet-trends/slide/53">http://techcrunch.com/gallery/mary-meeker-internet-trends/slide/53</a></p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t called out in the slides, but it&rsquo;s implied just about everywhere. The conversation is no longer about &ldquo;websites&rdquo;; it&rsquo;s about &ldquo;mobile&rdquo;, and it&rsquo;s about &ldquo;apps&rdquo;.  (It&rsquo;s always, <i>always</i> been about &ldquo;content&rdquo;.)</p>
<p>What does this mean for those of us who have been working on the &ldquo;Web&rdquo; for the last 10-20 years?</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a time to panic.  This is a time to be excited about the new possibilities. Everything we have learned about building scalable web applications is at least as important now as it has been. Moreover, building a mobile application using web technologies is still the cheapest and easiest way to get something running cross-platform in a hurry, and I would assert that 90% of what folks need to do in an &ldquo;app&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t require native code. Besides, the &ldquo;web&rdquo;, as it was invented, was all about linking documents, but we started building applications instead ten years ago!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s fondly remember the days when we cared about &ldquo;http://&rdquo; and &ldquo;.com&rdquo; and we squatted on domains during the internet land grab at the turn of the century.  Now lets <i>let it go</i>, and be proud that we have built a world where NO ONE HAS TO TYPE THAT CRAP EVER AGAIN.</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fun talk from a couple of weeks ago at Netflix about Reactive Extensions in Javascript.]]></title><description><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: embed--><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XRYN2xt11Ek?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><!--kg-card-end: embed-->]]></description><link>https://razorborg.com/fun-talk-from-a-couple-of-weeks-ago-at-netflix/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5ccc8317ab3d310001005121</guid><category><![CDATA[UI Engineering]]></category><category><![CDATA[Javascript]]></category><category><![CDATA[Netflix]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jan Borgersen]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2014 20:55:37 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1489389944381-3471b5b30f04?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1080&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: embed--><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XRYN2xt11Ek?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><!--kg-card-end: embed-->]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ira Glass on Creative Work]]></title><description><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: embed--><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/24715531?app_id=122963" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" title="Ira Glass on Storytelling" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><!--kg-card-end: embed--><p>I love Ira Glass’ message here about knowing what’s good, and knowing it takes a lot of hard work to get there.</p><p>Here in Silicon Valley it is easy to get sucked into the mantra of “Fail Early and Often”.

<p><a href="http://css-tricks.com/user-opt-out-responsive-design/">http://css-tricks.com/user-opt-out-responsive-design/</a></p>
<p>What&rsquo;s funny about this is some of our story with Zazzle&rsquo;s responsive redesign that launched over the summer.</p>
<p>It turns out that if you do a competitive analysis of large e-commerce sites on smartphones, you&rsquo;ll find <em>today</em> that most of them have a &ldquo;View Full Site&rdquo; link somewhere that sends you to, well, the full website, which you can then pinch-and-zoom all you like.  As a developer (and my designers agree), I rationalize this that a) these sites started doing a &ldquo;mobile&rdquo; friendly site some years ago, before we learned how to build a &ldquo;responsive&rdquo; site, b) the &ldquo;mobile&rdquo; friendly sites strip out a LOT of the content and interactivity of the full site, and c) it&rsquo;s possible these companies (especially the bigger ones) have entirely separate teams (possibly entirely separate agencies) working on each of these experiences.  The &ldquo;responsive&rdquo; hype really only caught on the end of last year, so this is the year we&rsquo;re beginning to see folks doing &ldquo;future-proof&rdquo; website design, and we anticipate that many of these sites will change how this works in the coming months.</p>
<p>This becomes an educational issue with non-technical folks who are used to seeing &ldquo;View Full Site&rdquo; links on their phones.  Regular users don&rsquo;t actually care that we&rsquo;re &ldquo;building for the future&rdquo; or that &ldquo;Responsive is the way to do it!&rdquo;  They have some expectations, and if your smartphone design fails them, they want to click &ldquo;View Full Site&rdquo; and feel like they&rsquo;re at their desktop.</p>
<p>More to the point, if you find yourself repeatedly having to explain what a &ldquo;breakpoint&rdquo; is, and why we took away pinch-and-zoom from you because <strong><italics>the mobile site is the same as the full site!</italics></strong>, there&rsquo;s something wrong with your design.</p>
<p>Which leads me to my primary learning this year:</p>
<p><strong>Implementing a &ldquo;responsive&rdquo; site is easy.<br>
Designing a &ldquo;responsive&rdquo; site is <i>HARD.</i></strong></p>
<p>Responsive sites have to scale in multiple dimensions, and they have to be legible across lots of screen sizes and pixel densities.  Samsung devices alone hit 4&quot;, 5&quot; 7&quot;, 8&quot;, and 10&quot;.  Set your breakpoint at 768 css pixels and your iPad renders like a desktop in portrait mode, but your Galaxy Tab renders like a smartphone in portrait and a desktop in landscape.  This implies that breakpoints are bad, but they&rsquo;re a really useful design crutch because a 5&quot; screen is a fundamentally different experience than a 10&quot; screen.</p>
<p>After iterating on our designs awhile and soliciting lots and lots of feedback, we came to the conclusion that sometimes, for some folks, on some devices, being able to pinch-and-zoom was a GOOD experience.  In particular, scaling to a &ldquo;desktop-like&rdquo; experience on 7-8&quot; tablets was a clear winner over seeing radically different layouts in portrait vs landscape mode.  Perhaps, with a lot of iteration and work, we could tune our experiences so that this does&rsquo;t matter, but we&rsquo;re simply not there now.</p>
<p>So why not bring back the &ldquo;View Full Site&rdquo; link?</p>
<p>I gave up on my idealism when I started learning SEO, why should I be a purist with such a nascent new way of building things?</p>
<p>The technical solution was straightforward &hellip; we did almost exactly what the article describes:  Add a link, drop a cookie with the user preference, and change our META VIEWPORT tag to force a screen width of 1024 css pixels (this happens to be the landscape width of an iPad), scale to the device width, and allow user-scaling. We also default all tablets to this mode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;View Full Site&rdquo; is, of course, a misnomer, but one couched in user expectations.  For us it means &ldquo;give me a scalable fixed-width site to pinch.&rdquo;  Our other adaptive mobile optimizations (native droplists instead of DHTML, fewer search results per page) still happen.</p>
<p>And does feel like a &ldquo;Full Site&rdquo; experience.  Which, ironically, is kinda the point of Responsive Design.</p><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Great WebDev Debates]]></title><description><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><strong><a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Great-WebDev-Debates/events/136998692/">The Great WebDev Debates</a></strong></p><p></p><p>Thanks to everyone who came to the Great WebDeb Debate tonight!

<p><strong>Set &ldquo;X-UA-Compatible&rdquo; (value: &ldquo;IE=10;IE=9;IE=8&rdquo;, or just &ldquo;IE=Edge&rdquo;) in your HTTP Headers, not in a META tag.</strong></p>
<p>It turns out that IE8 sees the Modernizer comments in the html and throws itself into compatibility mode before it sees the <meta> tag, and once you&rsquo;re in compatibility mode, the user has to override their own browser settings for your website to get themselves back into standards mode.  However, if you send the &ldquo;X-UA-Compatible&rdquo; setting in the HTTP Headers, IE8 sees that first, and sticks in standards mode.</p>

<p>At Zazzle, we are still a small engineering team, all working on the same application stack (at least, for public-facing sites), so this has been far less of an issue for us. We do our templating in server-side libraries, where we can also manage optimizations for high-performance web delivery.  Also, prior to Node.js, using a client-side solution was out of the question, since so much of what we do is driven by SEO needs.</p>
<p>However, it is very interesting to see where this is going.  Any organization attempting to implement a styleguide across multiple application stacks should be taking a good close look at Javascript frameworks, and thinking about running them on Node.js on the server.</p><p></p><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
